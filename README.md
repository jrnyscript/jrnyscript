- 👋 Hi, I’m @jrnyscript
- 👀 I’m interested in data science and statistics used to help repair the world and connect people with resources. 
- 🌱 I'm about to earn a master's in applied statistics and data analytics, and most recently I have been learning about data visualization. 
- 💞️ I'm looking to build more expertise in data cleaning and preparation, as well as practice my current skills and develop new ones.
